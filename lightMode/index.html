  <h1>Nowhere Boy Slide Project</h1>
  <h6>ELA project on the book <i>Nowhere Boy</i> by Katherine Marsh.</h6>
    <p>
      Nowhere boy is a compelling book with two perspectives, Ahmed and Max. <br>
Ahmed is a kind boy who is a refugee and homeless. <br>
Max is a boy who traveled to Brussels because his parents were in search of a "better" place for Max. <br>
Ahmed ends up in Turkey after bombings in Syria (his home) <br>
He gets to the coast of Greece through a boat and in turn lost his dad, his only family as the rest had been killed in a bomb. <br>
He then rides with a smuggler and eventually ends up in Brussels, also losing his phone. <br>
Ahmed happens to live in Max's house and lives in a wine "cellular" <br>
Max is very brave because he finds him and doesn't report him, he also is a nice kid because he didn't discriminate. <br>
